# Ready for the Project
You have learned everything needed to start and complete the project in this course.

In the Project: Query a Digital Music Store Database, you will be using a new data set. It will be a music store. However, as one final preparation, below is a fully completed project that uses the Parch and Posey Data you have been using. Hopefully, it will be an example you can use to guide your work in the project.

Important
If you would like to learn more SQL before completing the project, including how to create subqueries, temporary tables, and clean data, please complete the optional lessons below. These lessons are not required to complete the project but can help you better understand SQL and advance your skills even more.

Otherwise, you can go to the project after reviewing this sample project below.
Let's set up your local environment
It's totally fine to get started learning SQL here in the classroom, but the way to really master your skills is to get a local setup and learn to work within your own environment.

The environment we'll use is pretty quick to set up and hopefully you'll be up and running in no time :)

First you need to:

Download the database file here: Parch and Posey Database
Download DB Browser for SQLite: http://sqlitebrowser.org/
After both have been downloaded:

Open up DB Browser to SQLite
Click on Open Database
Navigate to the pandp.db file (probably in your downloads)
Click on the Execute SQL
Start querying your data
Example Project Prompt
In this project, you will query the Parch and Posey Database. The Parch and Posey Database holds information about a paper store. For this project, you will be assisting the Parch and Posey team with understanding their web traffic, their customers and employees, and their order information.

You need to come up with 4 questions that you can answer with SQL. The questions must be complex enough to where the SQL used to answer it requires at least one JOIN and one Aggregation.

Your presentation should include:

Four slides
One visualization per slide (You can export your query results from DB Browser to a csv and use Excel or any other spreadsheet software to create an appropriate chart)
A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
Submission Template
The submission template is a Google Slides file. Make a copy of the submission template to complete your project. We suggest you use the layout provided, though it is not a requirement. It is also attached below as a powerpoint file.

SUBMISSION TEMPLATE
Queries
Please include a text file that includes each of the queries used to create the visualizations. You should format your queries for readability, use this tool to help http://www.sql-format.com/. In a plain text file (use notepad, notepad++, or atom).

Completed Example Project
You can view the completed practice project by downloading the CompletedPracticeProject file below. In it will be a PDF of the 4 slides, each with a visualization and short explanation and a txt file with the queries used to find the data.

After looking through this please head to the actual project.
